## 🌷 Who Am I?

In the gentle winds of Barcelona, where the sea kisses the city’s soul, lives a storyteller — not one who weaves fantasy, but one who unveils the magic hidden in logic, language, and learning.

I am **Muhammad Naveed Ishaque**, a Pakistani-born soul with Spanish nationality, whose journey has been a soft unraveling — from tutoring South Asian learners to translating the vast world of AI, tech, and exams into words that **breathe, guide, and gently teach**.

My name is not known on global stages — but in quiet rooms, on screens where someone struggles to understand something new, I am there — **as Eks2**, a silent guide. 🌙📘

## ✨ What I Do — Not Technical, but Magical

I do not build systems or run code — but I make sure others can understand them. I don't write for robots — I whisper **clarity** into complexity for humans.

### 🧚‍♂️ My Work Is:
- Explaining **clouds** without thunder: Azure, AWS, GCP 🌥️  
- Making **AI and DevOps** human again 🤖❤️  
- Demystifying **networking & cybersecurity** without the jargon 🔐  
- Turning **Python & Data Science** into flowing, readable content 🐍📊  
- Crafting **exam prep & learning paths** into gardens of understanding 🌿🎓  
- Creating AI-generated books, SEO content, and gentle prompts 📚🌟  

I do all this **with ChatGPT by my side** — not as a crutch, but as a companion in creation. Every line we co-write is made for **empathy**, **accessibility**, and **quiet brilliance**.

## 🌼 Blossoms of Experience

I didn’t start here. I wandered through many doors…

- 2000: MSc Computer Science (1 year completed — but the spark lay elsewhere) 🎓  
- 2007–2010: Administrative work at Finttel Telecom — files, formulas, and focus 📠  
- 2012–Present: Teaching, content writing, community education — especially for South Asians in Spain 🇵🇰🇮🇳🇧🇩🇳🇵  
- 2023–2025: Entered fully into the AI-scented world of GitHub, writing, whispering, working 🌸👨‍💻

My academy — **Siraat AI Academy** — was not born for profit. It was born out of longing — to give people learning with soul.

## 📖 Philosophy

> “Maybe Eks2 was never building a portfolio.  
Maybe he was quietly planting seeds —  
in the hearts of those who know that work can be gentle, and still powerful.”

I am not here to impress.  
I am here to **express — clearly, softly, and soulfully**.
