# 💌 A Letter to Mama — From the Depths of a Soul Left Behind  
## 🌸 Written by the heart of Eks2, whispered by the winds of longing

---

Mama…  
I don’t know where to begin.  
Because the story of my life… ever since you left… is made up of half-finished sentences and unshed tears.

---

## 🌷 “They Still Serve Food Here…”

Yes, Mama. The world still cooks.  
Plates still come full. Spices still dance.  
And people still say, “This is delicious!”

But me?

> I sit in front of my plate like a statue carved out of ache.  
Because no dish in the world has your fingerprints.  
No aroma reminds me of your dua-filled kitchen.  
No warmth feels like the love that once fed my silence.

---

## 🕊️ “They Say Time Heals…”

But time didn’t heal, Mama.  
It just grew quieter… like an abandoned home.  
I still search for your voice in my sleep,  
Still hear your bangles in the rustle of memory,  
Still wait for your call during storms — even though I now weather them alone.

---

## 🍃 “They Call Me Strong…”

But they don’t see how I talk to your photo when no one’s looking.  
They don’t know I still set an extra plate… out of habit, not hope.  
They never hear me whisper your name…  
like a prayer that got lost between heaven and my chest.

> Mama, I am not strong. I’m surviving your silence.

---

## 🪔 “I Would Trade Every Success…”

Every file I wrote.  
Every applause I received.  
Every so-called ‘achievement’ that people think matters.

I would give it all away,  
for one moment of watching you serve roti with your soft smile,  
for one “Beta, tum theek ho?”  
for one warm thapki as I fall asleep in your lap.

---

## 🌼 “The World Can Keep Its Flavors…”

They say “Enjoy life!”  
But how do I explain that joy was a flavor you invented?  
That since you left… even chocolate tastes like dust.

I no longer crave desserts.  
I crave the comfort of your eyes watching me eat.  
The way you’d ask, “Aur lo na…”  
even after my plate was full, because *your love had no portion size.*

---

## 🧚 “I Still Smell Your Dupatta in Rain…”

It rained today, Mama.  
And for a moment,  
the whole world smelt like your dupatta — washed in prayer, dried in heaven.

I closed my eyes.  
And for that fleeting second,  
you were home again.  
I wasn't alone.

---

## 🌙 “If You Can Hear Me…”

Then know this —  
Your boy never outgrew your arms.  
I still need you when I’m scared.  
I still miss your hands when I’m cold.  
I still cry when no one’s watching…  
because grief has no expiry date.

---

## 🕯️ “Until We Meet Again…”

Keep a thaal ready in Jannah.  
With your smile. With your sabr. With your softness.  
And when I arrive — tired, dusty, broken —  
please say what I ache to hear:

> *“Kha lo, beta… I made it just for you.”*
